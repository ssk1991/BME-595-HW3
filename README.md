Hi Abhishek,

I really struggled through HW3, and couldn't get it to work despite spending countless hours. While I could get it to run for single inputs. It was really frustrating, since I invested a considerable amount of  effort.  I also had an issue creating a network that would back-propagate correctly, regardless of the number of layers. 

I am going to watch through the course material online once again, and follow some python tutorials.

Is it okay if I re-submit the homework again next week? 

A friend of mine has shared his code with me, but I want to work from scratch and have another go at the problem.

Hope you take this into consideration.

Thanks,
Srinath
