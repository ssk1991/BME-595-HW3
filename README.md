# BME-595-HW3

## NOT
## NOT gate origninally used, had theta              = [[-20], [10]]
## NOT gate created by neural_netowrk has theta      = [[-10.58], [5.18]]
## OR
### OR gate originally used, had theta               = [[20], [20], [-10]]
### OR gate created by neural_network has theta      = [[7.19],[7.19],[-3.35]]

## AND
### AND gate originally used, had theta              = [[20], [20], [-30]]
### AND gate created by neural_network has theta     = [[8.96], [8.96], [-13.54]]

## XOR
### XOR gate originally used, had theta_1            = [[20, -20], [20, -20], [-10, 30]]
### XOR gate created by neural_network has theta_1   = [[-5.35, -6.83], [-5.37, -6.88], [8, 2]]

### XOR gate originally used, had theta_2            = [[20], [20], [-30]]
### XOR gate created by neural_network has theta_1   = [[11.44], [-11.59], [-5.48]]
